# Cardio Disease Classification 💖

## Overview ℹ️

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying the presence of cardiovascular disease based on various medical factors. The dataset used contains a collection of attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels among others, which are used to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from [source link or description]. It consists of [number] instances with [number] features each, including both numerical and categorical attributes. Before training the model, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as cleaning missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

## Installation 🛠️

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shashikumar-r/CardioDiseaseClassifier.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd CardioDiseaseClassifier
   ```
   
### Jupyter Notebook 📒

For interactive exploration and running the project in a Jupyter Notebook environment:

1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed:
   ```
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```
   
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the notebook `Cardio-Disease-Classification.ipynb` and open it.

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute cells for training the model, evaluating performance, and making predictions.

### Training the Model 📚

To train the model outside of the notebook, run:
```
Cardio-Disease-Classification.ipynb
```
This script will preprocess the data, train the model using a specified algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, SVM), and save the trained model to disk.

### Evaluating the Model 📈

To evaluate the model on a test dataset, run:
```
Cardio-Disease-Classification.ipynb
```
This script will load the trained model and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Making Predictions 🔮

To use the trained model to make predictions on new data, run:
```
Cardio-Disease-Classification.ipynb
```
Replace `<path_to_input_data>` with the path to a CSV file containing new instances to classify.

## Model Selection 🧠

The project explores different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting to determine which one provides the best performance for this classification task. Evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
